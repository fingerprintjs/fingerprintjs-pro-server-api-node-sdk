  description: >
    Fingerprint Pro Server API allows you to get information about visitors and
    about individual events in a server environment. It can be used for data
    exports, decision-making, and data analysis scenarios.

    Server API is intended for server-side usage, it's not intended to be used
    from the client side, whether it's a browser or a mobile device.

      Using the Server API you can retrieve information about individual
      analysis events or event history of individual visitors.

        Smart Signals. 

        Please note that the response includes mobile signals (e.g. `rootApps`)
        even if the request originated from a non-mobile platform.

        It is highly recommended that you **ignore** the mobile signals for such
        requests. 


        Use `requestId` as the URL path parameter. This API method is scoped to
        a request, i.e. all returned information is by `requestId`.

        When an event is created, it is assigned `linkedId` and `tag` submitted
        through the JS agent parameters. This information might not be available
        on the client so the Server API allows for updating the attributes after
        the fact.


        **Warning** It's not possible to update events older than 10 days.

            Every identification request has a unique identifier associated with

            the identification
            [result](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/get-function#requestid).
            When you filter visits by `requestId`, only one visit will be

            You can use

            to associate identification requests with your own identifier, for
            example: session ID, purchase ID, or transaction ID. You can then

            Limit scanned results. 


            For performance reasons, the API first scans some number of events
            before filtering them. Use `limit` to specify how many events are
            scanned before they are filtered by `requestId` or `linkedId`.
            Results are always returned sorted by the timestamp (most recent
            first).

            By default, the most recent 100 visits are scanned, the maximum is
            500.

            Use `paginationKey` to get the next page of results. 


            When more results are available (e.g., you requested 200 results
            using `limit` parameter, but a total of 600 results are available),
            the `paginationKey` top-level attribute is added to the response.
            The key corresponds to the `requestId` of the last returned event.
            In the following request, use that value in the `paginationKey`
            parameter to get the next page of results:


            1. First request, returning most recent 200 events: `GET
            api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200`

            2. Use `response.paginationKey` to get the next page of results:
            `GET
            api-base-url/visitors/:visitorId?limit=200&paginationKey=1683900801733.Ogvu1j`


            Pagination happens during scanning and before filtering, so you can
            get less visits than the `limit` you specified with more available
            on the next page. When there are no more results available for
            scanning, the `paginationKey` attribute is not returned.

      summary: Delete data by visitor ID
      description: >
        Request deleting all data associated with the specified visitor ID. This
        API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations.

        ### Which data is deleted?

        - Browser (or device) properties

        - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)


        #### Browser (or device) properties

        - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific
        browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it.

        - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically
        within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this
        browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint
        Application](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-application).


        #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device)

        - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or
        device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more,
        see [Data
        Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).

        - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by
        this browser
          - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.
          - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.

        ### Corollary

        After requesting to delete a visitor ID,

        - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive
        a different visitor ID.

        - If you request [`/events`
        API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id`
        that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid
        response.

        - If you request [`/visitors`
        API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted
        visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were
        made outside of those 10 days.

        enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.

         * `RequestCannotBeParsed` - the query parameters or JSON payload contains some errors 
                  that prevented us from parsing it (wrong type/surpassed limits).
         * `TokenRequired` - `Auth-API-Key` header is missing or empty.
         * `TokenNotFound` - no Fingerprint application found for specified secret key.
         * `SubscriptionNotActive` - Fingerprint application is not active.
         * `WrongRegion` - server and application region differ.
         * `FeatureNotEnabled` - this feature (for example, Delete API) is not enabled for your application.
         * `RequestNotFound` - the specified request ID was not found. It never existed, expired, or it has been deleted.
         * `VisitorNotFound` - The specified visitor ID was not found. It never existed or it may have already been deleted.
         * `TooManyRequests` - the limit on secret API key requests per second has been exceeded.
         * `429 Too Many Requests` - the limit on secret API key requests per second has been exceeded.
         * `StateNotReady` - The event specified with request id is
                  not ready for updates yet. Try again.
                  This error happens in rare cases when update API is called immediately
                  after receiving the request id on the client. In case you need to send
