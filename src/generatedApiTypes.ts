    /**
     * Collect Automation Intelligence.
     * @description The Automation Intelligence API gives you the tools to determine whether traffic is legitimate and should be accepted by your application.
     *
     *     This feature is currently in a Public Preview testing phase. All feedback is welcome! If you encounter any issues, please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).
     *
     *     The API detects automation tools like AI Agents, AI Assistants, AI Browsers, and other bots. Additionally, it provides IP intelligence like geolocation, residential proxy, VPN and data center detection.
     *
     *     Automation Intelligence is derived from HTTP request metadata that reaches your server. It does not require the use of a JavaScript client-side agent or mobile SDKs to collect device context.
     *
     *     The API is fast, with average response times of less than 30ms, making it a great fit for edge, pre-origin or middleware contexts. The API is platform-agnostic and can be used with different CDN providers, cloud platforms, or any server backend.
     *
     *     Because this API doesn’t require the use of a client-side device collection agent, it doesn’t support device identification via `visitor_id` and a few Smart Signals derived from deep device telemetry.
     *
     *     ### Event Retrieval
     *
     *     Events created by the Automation Intelligence API can be fetched via the [`/v4/events/{event_id}`](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/server-api-get-event) API using the `event_id` present in the API response.
     *
     *     Fetch all Automation Intelligence API events via the [`/v4/events?source=edge`](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/server-api-search-events#parameter-source) API.

    /**
     * Search events
     * @description ## Search
     *
     *     The `/v4/events` endpoint provides a convenient way to search for past events based on specific parameters. Typical use cases and queries include:
     *
     *     - Searching for events associated with a single `visitor_id` within a time range to get historical behavior of a visitor.
     *     - Searching for events associated with a single `linked_id` within a time range to get all events associated with your internal account identifier.
     *     - Excluding all bot traffic from the query (`good` and `bad` bots)
     *
     *     By default, the API searches events from the last 7 days, sorts them by newest first and returns the last 10 events.
     *
     *     - Use `start` and `end` to specify the time range of the search.
     *     - Use `reverse=true` to sort the results oldest first.
     *     - Use `limit` to specify the number of events to return.
     *     - Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results if there are more than `limit` events.
     *
     *     ### Filtering events with the `suspect` flag
     *
     *     The `/v4/events` endpoint unlocks a powerful method for fraud protection analytics. The `suspect` flag is exposed in all events where it was previously set by the update API.
     *
     *     You can also apply the `suspect` query parameter as a filter to find all potentially fraudulent activity that you previously marked as `suspect`. This helps identify patterns of fraudulent behavior.
     *
     *     ### Environment scoping
     *
     *     If you use a secret key that is scoped to an environment, you will only get events associated with the same environment. With a workspace-scoped environment, you will get events from all environments.
     *
     *     Smart Signals not activated for your workspace or are not included in the response.

    /**
     * Delete a visitor ID
     * @description Use this API to request the deletion of all data associated with a specific visitor ID.
     *
     *     Upon a request to delete data for a visitor ID,
     *     - The data collected from the corresponding browser (or device) will be deleted asynchronously, typically within a few minutes. This data will no longer be available to identify this browser (or device). When the same browser (or device) revisits, it will receive a new visitor ID.
     *     - The identification events made from this browser (or device) in the past 10 days are typically deleted within 24 hrs.
     *     - The identification events made from this browser (or device) outside of the 10 days will be purged as per your [data retention period](https://docs.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).
     *
     *     The following timeline illustrates which events are deleted and which remain after a DELETE API request:
     *     ```
     *     Day 1:  First visit from browser A. (Assigned visitor ID: VID1000)
     *     Day 2:  Browser A revisits. (Assigned the same visitor ID: VID1000)
     *     Day 13: Browser A revisits. (Assigned the same visitor ID: VID1000)
     *     Day 14: Delete VID1000
     *     Day 15: Browser A re-visits. (Assigned a different visitor ID: VID9999)
     *     Day 15: GET /events/day-13 (Returns 404. The event is within the 10 days of deleting VID1000 and will have been deleted)
     *     Day 16: GET /events/day-2 (Returns 200. The event is outside of the 10 days of deleting VID1000 and is still available)
     *     ```
     *
     *     ### Availability
     *     This API is available only for Enterprise plans **upon request**. If you are interested, please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).
     *
     *     ### Rate limits and daily quota
     *     The rate limits and daily quota for this API **differ** from those for our other API.
     *
     *     The maximum number of DELETE requests that can be made in an hour cannot exceed 30 RPH, and the maximum number that can be made in a day cannot exceed 500 RPD.
     *
     *     You can request an increase to these limits by contacting [our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).
