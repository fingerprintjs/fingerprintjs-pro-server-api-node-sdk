     * Delete data by visitor ID
     * @description Request deleting all data associated with the specified visitor ID. This API is useful for compliance with privacy regulations.
     *     ### Which data is deleted?
     *     - Browser (or device) properties
     *     - Identification requests made from this browser (or device)
     *
     *     #### Browser (or device) properties
     *     - Represents the data that Fingerprint collected from this specific browser (or device) and everything inferred and derived from it.
     *     - Upon request to delete, this data is deleted asynchronously (typically within a few minutes) and it will no longer be used to identify this browser (or device) for your [Fingerprint Workspace](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/glossary#fingerprint-workspace).
     *
     *     #### Identification requests made from this browser (or device)
     *     - Fingerprint stores the identification requests made from a browser (or device) for up to 30 (or 90) days depending on your plan. To learn more, see [Data Retention](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).
     *     - Upon request to delete, the identification requests that were made by this browser
     *       - Within the past 10 days are deleted within 24 hrs.
     *       - Outside of 10 days are allowed to purge as per your data retention period.
     *
     *     ### Corollary
     *     After requesting to delete a visitor ID,
     *     - If the same browser (or device) requests to identify, it will receive a different visitor ID.
     *     - If you request [`/events` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getevent) with a `request_id` that was made outside of the 10 days, you will still receive a valid response.
     *     - If you request [`/visitors` API](https://dev.fingerprint.com/reference/getvisits) for the deleted visitor ID, the response will include identification requests that were made outside of those 10 days.
     *
     *     ### Interested?
     *     Please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable it for you. Otherwise, you will receive a 403.
